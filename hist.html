        The forts of Maharashtra are not merely architectural marvels; they are formidable guardians of a rich and tumultuous history. Each stone, each wall, and each gate has witnessed centuries of battles, strategic decisions, and the rise and fall of empires. From the ancient Satavahanas to the powerful Marathas, these forts have played a pivotal role in shaping the region's destiny.
